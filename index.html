<h2>The Price of a High: Death</h2>

    <p><b>Source: The State of Maryland, <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/total-number-of-drug-intoxication-deaths-by-selected-substances-2007-2016">Total Number of Drug Intoxication Deaths by Selected Substances: 2007-2016</a></b></p>
    <p>The State of Maryland has compiled data from autopsy and death reports relating to controlled substances. The data is important when looking at the opioid and prescription drug crisis in America. There is a connection between heroin and prescription drugs as both contain opioids. Opioids are generally synthesized from a painkiller like morphine. Many people addicted to these types of substances have a chemical dependency that causes it to even be painful if the substance in not in their bloodstream. Historically, drugs like <i>opioids are so dangerous that the British gave them to Chinese people during the Opium Wars to control trade in the region.</i></p>

<h2>A Connection: Drug Charges and Age Groups</h2>

    <p><b>Source: The Bureau of Justice Statistics, <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=datool&surl=/arrests/index.cfm#">Arrest Data Analysis Tool: Search by Age</a></b></p>
    <p>What is alarming about the drug crisis in America is the most affected age groups. College age people tend to be most vulnerable and willing to try different substances which can contribute to the nationwide death by overdose of drugs. I think this data communicated a mindset of “college age invincibility” and the naiveness of the hard reality of dangerous drugs like opioids. I also think that drugs inherently are dangerous and as people do them throughout their life, they are more likely to die. Getting drug charges early in someone’s adult life follows them for a long time and might influence someone to continue doing drugs due to hardship. This might explain the decrease in drug counts as a person is in a higher age range.</p>
